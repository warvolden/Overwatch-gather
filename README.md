A basic discord bot for Overwatch gather games.

Currently this just waits for 12 players to sign in, then shuffles them up
and splits them into two teams. There's a lot more to do before it's good,
just wanted to get what I'd done online.

To use:

* Get your bot a discord token by adding a new app at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and creating your app a bot user
* Add your bot to your guild by constructing a link from this https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#adding-bots-to-guilds - The permissions you will need are 3072, so your link will take the form https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your bot id>&scope=bot&permissions=3072
* Install python 3.5
* `pip install .` - if you intend to edit the code, use `pip install -e .`
* Put your bot's token into config.json (see config.json.example)
* Run `discord-gather`
